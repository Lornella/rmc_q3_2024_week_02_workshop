# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_cmnn_mini <- data_cmnn %>% 
                  rename(DALYs = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`) %>% 
                  filter(Entity == "Switzerland" | Entity == "Colombia" | Entity == "Japan")
```

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries.
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_cmnn_wide <- data_cmnn_mini %>% 
                  select(Entity, Year, DALYs) %>% 
                  pivot_wider(names_from = Entity, values_from = DALYs)

kable(data_cmnn_wide)
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
ggplot(data_cmnn_mini) +
       geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = DALYs, color = Entity)) +
  labs(color = "Country") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings

Colombia shows declaining number of DALYs but is still facing a higher number of DALYs copared to Switzerland and Japan.
